            <h1>Events</h1>
            <p>
                Use this site to create events that display on <a href="https://www.sba.gov/events/">sba.gov/events</a>.  Click the 
                menu options above to perform the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an Event</li>
                <li>View your Events</li>
                <li>Approve Events</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Create an Event</h2>
            <p>Use the <a href="create.html">Create an Event</a> page to submit events for consideration.  You'll follow five steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide basic information such as title, description, and the District Office sponsoring the event</li>
                <li>Specify the date, time, whether the event is in person or online, and if it's recurring</li>
                <li>Identify the physical location of the event</li>
                <li>List contact information, registration link, and if a cost is associated</li>
                <li>Finally, you'll be able to select whether you want to save a draft of your event or submit it immediately</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>View your Events</h2>
            <p>
                You can keep track of the events you've submitted and their status on the <a href="view.html">View Events</a> page.
                Click on the 'Review' link next to any event to modify the details of your event or submit it once you're ready.  After
                you press the 'Submit' button, you'll see the status change from Draft to Submitted for Approval.
            </p>
            <p>
                For recurring events, you will see a list of 'children' events that were generated as part of the criteria you selected.
            </p>
            <h2>Approve Events</h2>
            <p>
                If you are in a position to review and approve events, then you will see an extra menu option, which allows you to review
                the events submitted for approval.  If you're a supervisor that has a lot of events to approve, and you've already reviewed
                them for accuracy, then instead of approving them one at a time, you can use the Bulk Approve option to approve them all at once.
            </p>
